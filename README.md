# E-COMMERCE-WEBSITE

This website deals with almost all the features provided by the E-commerce websites out their. It uses Node.js as it's backend and react.js as it's frontend.
As it runs on the local machine you should have mongodb on your computer running. To view the records I will prefer to to have the database gui or viewer (like Robo 3T).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

To download the server Dependencies.


### 'cd client && npm i'

To download the client Dependencies.


### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
